    <h1>What Have We Learned So Far</h1>
    <h3 id="topicOne">HTML</h3>
    <h5 id="descOne">HTML is the first web making tool we learned at the start of BC skills. What it does is lay out a foundation for the website to have styles applied to it. The things that are built on websites in HTML are titles, paragraphs, tables, buttons, forms, and many more things that the website is built upon. This is the basic program for any programmer who is seeking to make a website has to use HTML, it can almost be thought of like the foundation of a house without nothing can be built on top to make it look good.</h5>
    <h3 id="topicTwo">CSS</h3>
    <h5 id="descTwo">After the HTML comes CSS once you build a good foundation for a website you can start to make your webpage look good by applying different styles and animations that can make your website more appealing to people. SOme example of these styles and animations are font size, colors, backgrounds, shaping up images, inserting shapes, borders, animations, and much more.</h5>
